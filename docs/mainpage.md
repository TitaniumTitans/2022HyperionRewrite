## About
This is auto-generated documentation for our FRC team's java code rewrite. You can find the repository containing all source code [here](https://github.com/TitaniumTitans/2022HyperionRewrite).
## Building
Doxygen will automatically run on a build, before code is compiled. To re-build manually, open the repo in `WPILib 2022 VS Code`, then press `CTRL + SHIFT + P` -> `WPILib: Run a command in Gradle` -> `doxygen`. The generated docs will be located under `2022HyperionRewrite/docs/html`.
## TODO:
* Add documentation to classes that don't have it
* Look into using github actions to generate doxygen
* Use github pages to host docs on their own site
* Look into readthedocs integration, or using readthedocs instead of doxygen
